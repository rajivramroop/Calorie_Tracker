Begun working on project. The barcode scanner is up but the app only loads a camera with no context upon start, and it does not read any data. We are trying to implement firebase and work on reading data ( 09/11/21)

there are several versions to this application. Thus far, we can scan a barcode with FDAid and it returns the amount of calories. We have initialized Firebase in the application and used it to allow for google authentication. However, there is currently no database working that will store and retrieve data (09/13/21)

Added navigation to the project to allow for multiple screens, but decided to pull out and focus more on getting the barcode scanner to improve. Added circular design to barcode so that there is a more focused scan ( 09/15/21). 

Decided to instead use anonymous authentication instead of google authentication, but we are still having trouble connecting to database. ( 09/17/21)

Database problem resolved, issues with expo install firebase, uploaded images on running application(09/19/21)
